# Processes and Signals Project for ALX SE Holberton School

## Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of processes and signals in Unix-like operating systems. Understanding how processes operate and communicate via signals is crucial for anyone working in system administration, software development, or cybersecurity.

## Features
- **Process Management*: Learn about creating, managing, and terminating processes.
- **Signals*: Understand how signals are used for inter-process communication and control.
- **Signal Handling*: Explore techniques for handling signals within a program.
- **Process Communication*: Dive into methods for processes to communicate with each other, including pipes, sockets, and shared memory.
- **Process Synchronization*: Understand how to synchronize processes using various mechanisms such as semaphores and mutexes.
- **Error Handling*: Learn best practices for error handling in process and signal-related operations.
- **Examples*: Find practical examples and exercises to reinforce concepts learned.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Refer to the documentation and examples provided to learn about processes and signals.
4. Experiment with the code examples to deepen your understanding.
5. Contribute by submitting pull requests for improvements, bug fixes, or additional examples.

## Requirements
